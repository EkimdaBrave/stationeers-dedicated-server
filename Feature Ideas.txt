- a random list of feature ideas and things -

-- IC code gets automagically saved in a dir (for when you forget to save it in the Library side-bar)
    - use case - code gets overwritten and no-one knows who wrote it :-) 

-- make spawn points 'sticky' after a server re-load ?
 - our resident hermit has to travel to their 'Sekrit Lair' when the re-log 


-- Chat popup 'in yer face'

- an API so I can make my flashy lights go off when things get dicey
    (I am using WLED on an ESP32 chip, the automation is easy, I just need to find somewhere to hook it into, in game)

- of course, the 'elcetrical switch box' new part with screws on it so you ccan run indepedant power feeds thru one frame and make things look tidier
    - bonus effect, people will fuck it up and cause mayhem!

 chunk ownership, personal security cards, anti-griff, a reboot bot that reloads the last autosave when the thing dies.
Montugar: a filter so clients do get the dev spam messages


] LAJ-47FC9 (they/them): Logic gates.
[13:29] LAJ-47FC9 (they/them): It'd make advanced logic more feasible without forcing people into IC10 or a million logic gates for something as simple as three-point light control.
[13:31] LAJ-47FC9 (they/them): Oh oh
[13:31] LAJ-47FC9 (they/them): two or more wall corners in the same small grid space
[13:32] LAJ-47FC9 (they/them): vending machines should have built-in stackers
[13:35] LAJ-47FC9 (they/them): and the switch on vending machines should be on the front



---- long standing requests ----
- duct tape and cable are 'tools' and can go in a tool slot in a tool belt
 is there any chance of making spray pain the same ? 
 It'd be a tiny liitle QoL improvement (MK2 tool belkt as the 'graffiti belt')

--- integration ideas ----
write some scrript things to poll the master server (occasionally) and check 
    a: if it's visible 
    and 
    b: how many people are connected
    [c: is the connected count true ? ]
- post up/downs to an announce channel in Discord 

---- Troll ideas ----

Maze of Doom 
- player takes wrong turn, gets;
    transported to start
    gets their battery nicked and THAT gets transported somewhere for them to find
    open their faceplate at random 


- trig and auto-on /off for lights / machines etc 

gas/temp/player/weather/power sensords feeding monitors / indicators in a CENTRAL CONTROL ROOM!!!
